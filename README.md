this is a very rudimental tool to monitor and send alert mails when you have and HP Smartarray compatible with cciss driver, 

I had a P212 with cache. 

the script has been written when I was starting to learn python, therefore the excessive rudimental application of what I knew. 

It monitors the volume on the 4 disks I had attached to the controller, the disks and the battery status. 

IF there is something that's not "OK" (for the battery, also the recharging status is not ok) sends you an email.
